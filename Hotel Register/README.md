# Hotel Register

This is an OOP project which is about the usual procedures that every hotel go through when guests are registered.

It contains several classes which are connected with each-other:

A Room class, which is the base class for all kinds of rooms that the hotel has.    
A Guest class, which will store the guests data and will be initialized when a guest is being registered.   
And the main class - Hotel, which has a few methods:
#### .add_room
#### .register_guests
#### .free_room
#### .get_room_info
#### .info

I tried to follow the main OOP principles and make the project as simple and useful as possible.
